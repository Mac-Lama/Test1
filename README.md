# ðŸ“š Library Management System

A console-based Library Management System that allows users to manage a personal library by adding, removing, searching, and sorting books. This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, recursion, and file I/O in Java.

## âœ¨ Features

- Add new books (Fiction or Textbook) with detailed information
- Remove books by ISBN
- Display all books sorted by **title** or **author**
- Recursive search for books by title
- In-memory storage using `ArrayList`
- Persistent storage using file I/O
- Error handling for invalid input and file operations
- Demonstrates:
  - Inheritance (`Book`, `FictionBook`, `Textbook`)
  - Polymorphism (handling different book types generically)
  - Interface implementation (`Comparable<Book>` for sorting)
  - Recursion (title-based search)
  - Abstract classes and method overriding
