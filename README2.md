# Personal Library Management System

This system allows users to add, remove, sort, and search for books stored in memory / a file. The project allows the user to:
  - Add a new book to the collection/database, based on whether it is a textbook or a fiction book.
  - Remove a book using the ISBN.
  - See a display of the books, and choose whether to sort by title or author.
  - Search for a book by title using a recursive search algorithm.
  - Store books in the memory using an ArrayList.
  - Persist the books in a file using file I/O.
      - When the application restarts, it loads from the filesystem.

This system also:
  - Uses exception handling to catch invalid input or file errors.
  - Implements the Comparable interface for sorting.
